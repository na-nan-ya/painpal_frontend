### POST /api/PainLocationScoring/_addMapForTesting

This method bypasses the normal concept rules because it's purely for setting up test data.

**Requirements:**
- (No explicit requirements)

**Effects:**
- (No explicit effects beyond database insertion for testing)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "user": "string",
