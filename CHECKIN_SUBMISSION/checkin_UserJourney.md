# Prototype User Journey 

A user wakes up with a noticeable level of pain for the sixth day in a row. This time, they feel it in their neck and on the right side of their head. They want to note it down for record purposes but find it tedious to manually keep track of all the details for more than 2-3 days. The user opens PainPal on their PC where a fresh BodyMap has been automatically generated since it is a new day. They click on the neck, slide the marker on a scale from 1 to 10 in the pop-up dialog and save the score. Similarly, they rotate the Map to the right-facing position and highlight the head, score it an 8 and save it. Later in the afternoon, they feel a sharp pain in their right leg. Aiming to log this on PainPal, they open the existing Map and accidentally click on the left foot. They deselect and once again, accidentally click on the left leg, score it, and save it. They delete the scored region and finally select the right leg and score it. This map is automatically saved at the end of the day.
